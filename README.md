## **SWE Interview Notes and LeetCode Python Solutions**

<br />

## The Rundown

<br />

*This is a collection of some of my personal notes that I took while studying for SWE interviews as well as Python solutions from LeetCode questions that I have completed. All LeetCode solution files are named according to their corresponding question number on LeetCode. This does not encompass every topic but it is a good foundational start to studying for SWE. I hope the notes are clear and helpful and that the structure gives you a new way to take more notes of your own. Good luck studying!*
