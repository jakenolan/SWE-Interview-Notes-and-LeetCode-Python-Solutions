### SWE Interview Notes and LeetCode Python Solutions

---

*A carefully curated collection of my software engineering notes and Python solutions from LeetCode questions that I used to find my first job. All LeetCode solution files are named according to their corresponding question number on LeetCode. This does not encompass every topic but it is a good foundational start to studying for SWE. I hope the notes are clear and helpful and the structure gives you a new way to take more notes of your own. Good luck studying!*
