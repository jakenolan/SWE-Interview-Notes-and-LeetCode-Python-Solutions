## **Big O Notation**

---

<br />

## Explanation

<br />

*A notation to classify how an algorithm's run time or space requirements scale as the input size grows.*

<br />

Complexities:
- Time complexity is the amount of time that an algorithm takes as a function of the input.
- Space complexity is the amount of space/memory that an algorithm uses based on a function of the input.

<br />

Complexity Terms:
- Constant time: O(1)
- Logarithmic time: O(logn)
- Linear time: O(n)
- Linear logarithmic time: O(nlogn)
- Quadratic time: O(n^2)
- Exponential time: O(2^n)
- Factorial time: O(n!)

<br />

Order of Terms
```
O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)
```
